HormonomicsDB is a tool developed at UBC Okanagan by the plantSMART research team to allow users to process their
 untargeted metabolomics data to putativley identify plant hormones.

## Current Features (v1.3)
* About 250 Plant Hormones
* The HormonomicsDB shell to allow users to use their own dataset.

## How to run locally:
1. Download the most recent version of HormonomicsDB
2. Make sure that your version of R and R Studio are up to date. To do this run the following:
```

```
3. Place all the .csv files and R file in the same directory, set this directory (or file) as your working directory in R Studio.

4. Compile the code in R Studio. If everything is up to date, then the code should compile succesfully and you will find a new window has opened with the application in it. You are now free to use HormonomicsDB on your local device, wthout internet connection!!
